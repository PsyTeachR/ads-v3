There are many other things you can do with R and quarto, some of which are listed below. \n\n## Plots\n\n@sec-more-plots will introduce you to some more plot styles, like maps and word clouds, and things you can do with plots, such as add annotations.\n\nLisa participated in the 2022 30 Day Chart Challenge and ended up collecting all 30 plots in a [tutorial book](https://debruine.github.io/30DCC-2022/) with step-by-step explanations of how they created them. \n\n![An example map plot with annotations](images/appx/third-gender.png){#fig-third-gender fig-alt=\"Countries which include a third-gender marker on their passport, April 2022 USA, Canada, Colombia, Argentina, Germany, Austria, Netherlands, Denmark, Ireland, Malta, Iceland, Austria, Australia, New Zealand, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal. Plot is in the visual style of plots from The Economist.\"}\n\n## Websites and Other Outputs\n\nWe've been concentrating on creating single documents with quarto, but you can do much more with it, such as create presentations and websites. See the [quarto guide](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) for a list of everything that it can do.\n\n@sec-webpages will teach you how to create a simple webpage using <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/q#quarto' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='An open-source scientific and technical publishing system.'>quarto</a>, link multiple pages, and style your content using <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/c#css' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='Cascading Style Sheet: A system for controlling the visual presentation of HTML in web pages.'>css</a>.\n\nYou can easily create presentations using revealjs in quarto. Get started by creating a new quarto document, pasting in the following, and rendering it. \n\n``` markdown\n---\ntitle: \"Presentation Title\"\nauthor: \"Your Name\"\nformat: revealjs\n---\n\n## Slide 1 Title\n\n- Bullet Point 1\n- Bullet Point 2\n\n## Slide 2 Title\n\n. . .\n\n- Bullet Point 1\n\n. . .\n\n- Bullet Point 2\n```\n\nCheck the [revealjs quarto docs](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/) for many more things you can do with presentations.\n\n## R Packages\n\nMaking an R package develops generic coding skills and gives you valuable insight to how R works. The book [Creating an R Package](https://psyteachr.github.io/intro-r-pkgs/) covers setting up a package project, creating functions, documenting them with roxygen, creating vignettes, unit testing, package testing, version control with git, and distribution with github.\n\n## Data Simulation\n\nLisa frequently teaches workshops on data simulation using the <pkg>faux</pkg> R package they wrote. You can access the materials for these workshops at [DataSim Workshops](https://debruine.github.io/data-sim-workshops/).\n\n### Data Simulation with {faux}\n\nThis lesson covers the basics of simulation using {faux}. We will simulate data with factorial designs by specifying the within and between-subjects factor structure, each cell mean and standard deviation, and correlations between cells where appropriate. This can be used to create simulated data sets to be used in preparing the analysis code for pre-registrations or registered reports. We will also create data sets for simulation-based power analyses. Students will need to have very basic knowledge of R and R Markdown, and have installed {faux}, {afex}, {broom} and {tidyverse}.\n\n### Data simulation for mixed designs\n\nThis lesson covers simulating data for a mixed design, where trials are crossed with subjects. We will learn how to analyse this using {lme4}, with a focus on understanding how the simulation parameters correspond to the output. Finally, we will learn how to use simulation to calculate power. Students will need to have basic knowledge of R and R Markdown, some familiarity with mixed designs (even if they donâ€™t currently analyse them with mixed models) and have installed {faux}, {afex}, {tidyverse}, and {lme4}.\n\n## Quarto and Other Coding Languages\n\nR is not the only coding language you can use with quarto to make your research more reproducible. Quarto supports many coding languages, such as [python](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/python.html) and [julia](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/julia.html). If you also use one of these languages, try setting up a quarto document with it.\n\n## Shiny Apps\n\n<a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/s#shiny' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='An R package that builds interactive web apps'>Shiny</a> lets you make web applications that do anything you can code in R. For example, you can share your data analysis in a dynamic way with people who don't use R, collect and visualize data, or even make data aRt. Try the [Getting Started in Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/r/getstarted/shiny-basics/lesson1/) tutorial on Posit.\n\n<!--\nWhile there is a wealth of material available on the internet to help you get started with Shiny, it can be difficult to see how everything fits together. The book [ShinyIntro](https://debruine.github.io/shinyintro/) will teach you the basics of Shiny app programming, giving you skills that will form the basis of almost any app you want to build. By the end of the book, you will have created a custom app that collects and saves data, allows users to dynamically visualize the data, and produces downloadable reports.\n-->\n",
