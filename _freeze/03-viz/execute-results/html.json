A grammar of graphics (the \"gg\" in \"ggplot\") is a standardised way to describe the components of a graphic. <pkg>ggplot2</pkg> uses a layered grammar of graphics, in which plots are built up in a series of layers. It may be helpful to think about any plot as having multiple elements that sit semi-transparently over each other. A good analogy is old Disney movies where artists would create a background and then add moveable elements on top of the background via transparencies.\n\n@fig-layers displays the evolution of a simple scatterplot using this layered approach. First, the plot space is built (layer 1); the variables are specified (layer 2); the type of visualisation (known as a `geom`) that is desired for these variables is specified (layer 3) - in this case `geom_point()` is called to visualise individual data points; a second geom is added to include a line of best fit (layer 4), the axis labels are edited for readability (layer 5), and finally, a theme is applied to change the overall appearance of the plot (layer 6).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Evolution of a layered plot](03-viz_files/figure-html/fig-layers-1.png){#fig-layers fig-align='center' fig-alt='A grid of 6 layers buidling up a plot. 1: A blank plot. 2: Adds the x-axis `gini` with ticks 0.3 to 0.6 and the y-axis `welfare_mean` with ticks form 0 to 80. 3: Adds blue scatterplot points. 4: Adds a linear trendline with error shading. 5: Changes the x-axis label to `Gini Index` and the y-axis label to `Mean Welfare (log10)` and the y-axis to a log10 scale with ticks at 3, 10, 30 and 100. 6: Changes the y-axis ticks to 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nImportantly, each layer is independent and independently customisable. For example, the size, colour and position of each component can be adjusted, or one could, for example, remove the first geom (the data points) to only visualise the line of best fit, simply by removing the layer that draws the data points (@fig-remove-layer). The use of layers makes it easy to build up complex plots step-by-step, and to adapt or extend plots from existing code.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Final plot with scatterplot layer removed.](03-viz_files/figure-html/fig-remove-layer-1.png){#fig-remove-layer fig-align='center' fig-alt='A regression line with Gini Index on the x-axis and Mean Welfare (log10) on the y-axis, showing a negative relationship from 2.5 gini/30 welfare to 6.5 gini/5 welfare.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Loading data {#sec-plots-loading-data}\n\nLet's build up the plot above, layer by layer. First we need to get the data. We'll learn how to load data from different sources in @sec-data, but this time we'll use the same method as we did in @sec-loading-online and load it from an online source. \n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Activity\n\nLoad the data by copying the following into a code block in your script, and running the code.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npip <- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PsyTeachR/ads-v3/refs/heads/master/data/pip_gini_welfare_2010.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\nWhen you load the data, `read_csv()` will produce a message that gives you information about the data it has imported and what assumptions it has made. The \"column specification\" tells you what each column is named and what type of data R has categorised each variable as. The abbreviation \"chr\" is for <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/c#character' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='A data type representing strings of text.'>character</a> columns, \"dbl\" is for <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/d#double' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='A data type representing a real decimal number'>double</a> columns, and \"dttm\" is a date/time column.\n\nThis data is from the World Bank's [Poverty and Inequality Platform](https://pip.worldbank.org/poverty-calculator) (accessed on 2025-08-05).\n\nThe first thing you should do when you need to plot data is to get familiar with what all of the rows (observations) and columns (variables) mean. Sometimes this is obvious, and sometimes it requires help from the data provider. Here, each row represents data for one region for one year.\n\n* `region_name` is the name of the world region, like \"South Asia\"\n* `region_code` is the 3-letter abbreviation for region\n* `country_name` is the name of the country \n* `country_code` is the 3-letter country code\n* `reporting_year` is a year 1963 - 2024\n* `reporting_level` is \"national\" for this entire dataset\n* `gini` is a measure of inequality that ranges from 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (complete inequality)\n* `welfare_mean` is average welfare per capita (see the [methodology page](https://datanalytics.worldbank.org/PIP-Methodology/) for more info on how this is calculated)\n* `welfare_median` is the amount of welfare per capita that divides the distribution into two equal halves\n\n\n### Plot setup\n\n#### Default theme\n\nPlots in this book use the black-and-white theme, not the default grey theme, so set your default theme to the same so your plots will look like the examples below. At the top of your script, in the setup chunk after you've loaded the tidyverse package, add the following code and run it. You'll learn more ways to customise your theme in @sec-themes and @sec-themes-appendix.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Activity\n\nAdd this code to your setup chunk. It needs to run before you make the first plot in this script.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntheme_set(theme_bw()) # set the default theme\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n#### Data {#sec-plot-setup-data}\n\nEvery plot starts with the `ggplot()` function and a data table. If your data are not loaded or you have a typo in your code, this will give you an error message. It's best to check your plot after each step, so that you can figure out where errors are more easily.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Activity\n\nIn a new code chunk, create a blank plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = pip)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03-viz_files/figure-html/img-build-plot-1.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='A blank plot' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n#### Mapping\n\nThe next <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/a#argument' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='A variable that provides input to a function.'>argument</a> to `ggplot()` is the `mapping`. This tells the plot which columns in the data should be represented by, or \"mapped\" to, different aspects of the plot, such as the x-axis, y-axis, line colour, object fill, or line style. These aspects, or \"aesthetics\", are listed inside the `aes()` function.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Activity\n\nSet the arguments `x` and `y` to the names of the columns you want to be plotted on those axes. Here, we want to plot `gini` (the measure of inequality) on the x-axis and `welfare_mean` (average welfore per capita) on the y-axis.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# set up the plot with mapping\nggplot(\n  data = pip, \n  mapping = aes(x = gini, y = welfare_mean)\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03-viz_files/figure-html/img-build-plot-mapping-1.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='An empty plot with `gini` on the x-axis and `welfare_mean` on the y-axis' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\nIn the example above, we wrote out the names of the <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/a#argument' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='A variable that provides input to a function.'>arguments</a> `data` and `mapping`, but in practice, almost everyone omits them. Just make sure you put the data and mapping in the right order.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(pip,  aes(x = gini, y = welfare_mean))\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### Label Attributes {#sec-ggplot-labels}\n\nYou probably don't want the axis labels to read \"gini\" and \"welfare_mean\". These are great column labels that fit our rules for naming objects in R (@sec-naming), but are not plot-friendly. \n\nBefore ggplot2 version 4.0.0, you had to always manually change the aesthetic labels with `labs()` or a scale_* function. But now you can add plot-friendly labels directly to the data table so they are always used. \n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Activity\n\nUpdate the labels for each variable.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# set label attributes\nattr(pip$region_name, \"label\") <- \"Region\"\nattr(pip$region_code, \"label\") <- \"Region\"\nattr(pip$country_name, \"label\") <- \"Country\"\nattr(pip$country_code, \"label\") <- \"Country\"\nattr(pip$reporting_year, \"label\") <- \"Year\"\nattr(pip$gini, \"label\") <- \"Gini Index\"\nattr(pip$welfare_mean, \"label\") <- \"Mean Welfare per Capita\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution}\nIf this doesn't work, check what version of ggplot2 you're using with `packageVersion(\"ggplot2\")`.\n:::\n\n\n#### Geoms\n\nNow we can add our plot elements in layers. These are referred to as <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/g#geom' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='The geometric style in which data are displayed, such as boxplot, density, or histogram.'>geoms</a> and their functions start with `geom_`. You **add** layers onto the base plot created by `ggplot()` with a plus (`+`). \n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Activity\n\nAdd a scatterplot to your plot using `geom_point()`. Notice how the axis labels have updated themselves from the label attributes we set above!\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(pip,  aes(x = gini, y = welfare_mean)) +\n  geom_point() # scatterplot\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03-viz_files/figure-html/img-build-plot-labels-1.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='A plot with axis labels and points' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution}\n## Location of the +\n\nSomewhat annoyingly, the plus has to be on the end of the previous line, not at the start of the next line. If you do make this mistake, it will run the first line of code to produce the base layer but then you will get the following error message rather than adding on `geom_point()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(pip,  aes(x = gini, y = welfare_mean))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03-viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='A plot with axis labels, but no scatterplot' width=100%}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n+ geom_point() # scatterplot\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n```\nError:\n! Cannot use `+` with a single argument.\nℹ Did you accidentally put `+` on a new line?\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n### Multiple geoms\n\nPart of the power of <pkg>ggplot2</pkg> is that you can add more than one geom to a plot by adding on extra layers and so it quickly becomes possible to make complex and informative visualisations. Importantly, the layers display in the order you set them up. The code below uses the same geoms to produce a boxplot with the raw data points, but orders them differently.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# points on top of boxplot\nggplot(pip, aes(x = region_name, y = welfare_mean)) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .2) +\n  geom_jitter(width = .2) +\n  coord_flip()\n\n# points underneath boxplot \nggplot(pip, aes(x = region_name, y = welfare_mean)) +\n  geom_jitter(width = .2) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .2) +\n  coord_flip()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Points on top vs points underneath](03-viz_files/figure-html/fig-build-plot-geom2-1.png){#fig-build-plot-geom2 fig-align='center' fig-alt='Two nearly identical plots with boxplots plus raw data points. In the left plot, the points are underneath the boxplot, and in the right plot they are on top.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Plot objects\n\nJust like you can save numbers and data tables to objects, you can also save the output of `ggplot()`. The code below produces the same plots we created above but saves them to objects named `points_top` and `points_bottom`. If you run just this code, the plots won't display like they have done before. Instead, you'll see the object names appear in the environment pane.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# points on top of boxplot\npoints_top <- ggplot(pip, aes(x = region_name, y = welfare_mean)) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .2) +\n  geom_jitter(width = .2) +\n  coord_flip()\n\n# points underneath boxplot \npoints_bottom <- ggplot(pip, aes(x = region_name, y = welfare_mean)) +\n  geom_jitter(width = .2) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .2) +\n  coord_flip()\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo view the plots, call the objects by name. This will output each plot separately.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npoints_top # view first plot\npoints_bottom # view second plot\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Activity\n\nSave your two plots to objects with appropriate names and then view them.\n:::\n\n\n### Combining plots\n\nOne of the reasons to save your plots to objects is so that you can combine multiple plots using functions from the `patchwork` package. The  code below produces the plot above by combining the two plots with `+` and then specifying that we want the plots produced on a single row with the `nrow` argument in `plot_layout()`. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add plots together in 1 row\npoints_top + points_bottom + plot_layout(nrow = 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Combining plots with patchwork.](03-viz_files/figure-html/fig-build-plot-geom2b-1.png){#fig-build-plot-geom2b fig-align='center' fig-alt='The points_top and points_bottom plots displayed in one image side-by-side.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Activity\n\n1. Combine your plots using `plot_layout()`. \n2. Try changing the value of `nrow` to 2.\n3. Add the argument `axes = \"collect\"` to `plot_layout()`. Use the help documentation for additional explanation on what it does.\n:::\n\nThe [`patchwork` documentation](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/articles/guides/layout.html) has some great resources and examples of all the different ways in which you can adjust the layout when you combine multiple plots.\n\n\n## Customising plots\n\nThere are nearly endless ways to customise ggplots. We'll cover a few of the basic customisations here.\n\n### Styling geoms\n\nFor our scatterplot, We should definitely put the line in front of the points, but the points are still a bit dark. If you want to change the overall style of a geom, you can set the arguments `colour`, `alpha`, `shape`, `size` and `linetype` inside the geom function. There are many different values that you can set these to; @sec-plotstyle gives details of these. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(pip,  aes(x = gini, y = welfare_mean)) +\n  geom_point(colour = \"dodgerblue\", \n             alpha = 0.2, # 20% transparency\n             shape = 18,  # solid diamond\n             size = 2) + \n  # setting method & formula avoids an annoying message\n  geom_smooth(method = lm,   # method of linear model (lm)\n              formula = y~x, # formula used to draw line\n              colour = rgb(0, .5, .8),\n              linetype = 3) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Changing geom styles.](03-viz_files/figure-html/fig-build-plot-style-1.png){#fig-build-plot-style fig-align='center' fig-alt='The same scatter-line plot as above, but the points are transparent blue diamonds instead of solid black circles, and the regression line is dotted and blue instead of solid and blue.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Activity\n\nPlay around with different values above and figure out what the <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/d#default-value' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='A value that a function uses for an argument if it is skipped.'>default values</a> are for `shape` and `size`. \n:::\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n## Setting aesthetics overall versus by category\n\nThis method is only for changing the style of *all* the shapes made with that geom. If you want, for example, points to have different colours depending on which region they are from, you set the argument `colour = region` inside the `aes()` function for the mapping. You can customise the colours used with `scale_` functions, which you will learn about below and in @sec-plotstyle.\n:::\n\n### Format axes\n\nNow we need to make the axes look neater. There are several functions you can use to change the axis labels, but the most powerful ones are the `scale_` functions. You need to use a scale function that matches the data you're plotting on that axis and this is where it becomes particularly important to know what type of data you're working with. Both of the axes here are <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/c#continuous' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='Data that can take on any values between other existing values.'>continuous</a>, so we'll use `scale_x_continuous()` and `scale_y_continuous()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(pip,  aes(x = gini, y = welfare_mean)) +\n  geom_point(colour = \"dodgerblue\", \n             alpha = 0.2) + \n  geom_smooth(method = lm, \n              formula = y~x, \n              colour = rgb(0, .5, .8)) +\n  # customise axis labels and breaks\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = .1))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Formatting plot axes with scale_ functions.](03-viz_files/figure-html/fig-build-plot-axes-1.png){#fig-build-plot-axes fig-align='center' fig-alt='The same scatter-line plot as above, but the points are transparent blue circles, and the regression line is a solid blue.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe `name` argument changes the axis label. The `breaks` argument sets the major units and needs a <a href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/v#vector' target='_blank' class='glossary' title='A type of data structure that collects values with the same data type, like T/F values, numbers, or strings.'>vector</a> of possible values, which can extend beyond the range of the data (e.g., `gini` values in this set are only between 0.2 and 0.7, but we can specify breaks 0-1 to make the maths easier or anticipate updates to the data). The `seq()` function creates a sequence of numbers `from` one `to` another `by` specified steps.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-summary=\"Example of seq()\"}\nseq(from = 0, to = 1, by = .1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n [1] 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Activity\n\nSet the y-axis name to \"Mean Welfare per Capita\" and the breaks to every 20 with minor breaks every 5.

Let's add the light theme, but change the font size to 11 with the `base_size` argument.\n\nIt's also worth highlighting that this code is starting to look quite complicated because of the number of layers, but because we've built it up slowly it should (hopefully!) make sense.

Different types of data require different types of plots, so this section is organised by data type. \n\nThe [ggplot2 cheat sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/data-visualization.pdf) is a great resource to help you find plots appropriate to your data, based on how many variables you're plotting and what type they are. The examples below all use the same poverty and inequality platform data, but each plot communicates something different. \n\nWe don't expect you to memorise all of the plot types or the methods for customising them, but it will be helpful to try out the code in the examples below for yourself, changing values to test your understanding.\n\n### Counting categories\n\n#### Bar plot\n\nIf you want to count the number of things per category, you can use `geom_bar()`. You only need to provide a `x` mapping to `geom_bar()` because by default `geom_bar()` uses the number of observations in each group of `x` as the value for `y`, so you don't need to tell it what to put on the y-axis.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(pip, aes(x = region_code)) +\n  geom_bar()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A basic bar plot.](03-viz_files/figure-html/fig-bar-1.png){#fig-bar fig-align='center' fig-alt='A bar plot with region_code on the x-axis with 7 categories and count on the y-axis, ranging from 0 to 30.

This is like a density plot, but rotated 90 degrees and mirrored - the fatter the violin, the larger proportion of data points there are at that value.\n\n`geom_violin()` provides three scaling options. With scale = \"area\" (the default), each violin has the same total area, so widths reflect density only. With scale = \"count\", the maximum width is proportional to the number of observations, so larger groups appear wider.

The box encloses the 25th to 75th percentiles of the data, so 50% of the data falls inside the box. The \"whiskers\" extending above and below the box extend 1.5 times the height of the box, although you can change this with the `coef` argument.

Here, we want to see if longer wait times cause the calls to be longer. \n\n#### Scatterplot\n\nThe function to create a scatterplot is called `geom_point()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(pip,  aes(x = gini, y = welfare_mean)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scatterplot with geom_point().\"](03-viz_files/figure-html/fig-demo-point-1.png){#fig-demo-point fig-align='center' fig-alt='A scatterplot with gini (0.2-0.7) on the x-axis and welfare_mean (0-90) on the y-axis.

The shaded ribbon around the line shows how confident the model is: a narrow ribbon means the pattern is fairly certain, while a wide ribbon means the data are too sparse or variable to be sure. Different methods create lines with different levels of flexibility. \n\nA linear model draws the simplest possible line, which is straight from one side of the plot to the other. A loess line adapts more to the data, so it can curve or wiggle if the pattern changes. A quadratic model sits between these two: it is still smooth, but it allows for a single bend. None of these lines are “the truth”. They are tools to help you see overall trends, and the choice between them depends on how simple or flexible you want your summary of the data to be.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nloess_plot <- \n  ggplot(pip,  aes(x = gini, y = welfare_mean)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +\n  geom_smooth(method = loess, formula = y~x) +\n  ggtitle(\"Default: method = loess, formula = y~x\")\n\nlm_plot <- \n  ggplot(pip,  aes(x = gini, y = welfare_mean)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm, formula = y~x) +\n  ggtitle(\"Linear: method = lm, formula = y~x\")\n\nlm2_plot <- \n  ggplot(pip,  aes(x = gini, y = welfare_mean)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm, formula = y~x + I(x^2)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Quadratic: method = lm, formula = y~x + I(x^2)\")\n\nloess_plot / lm_plot / lm2_plot \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Different ways to show the relationship between two continuous variables.](03-viz_files/figure-html/fig-2-continuous-1.png){#fig-2-continuous fig-align='center' fig-alt='Thre versions of a trend line trhough the scatterplot above with gini (0.2-0.7) on the x-axis and welfare_mean (0-90) on the y-axis.

The mean column calculates an expected score for each observation by combining the month (extracted with `month(datetime)`) and the rating, so scores tend to rise later in the year and vary depending on how far the rating is from the midpoint. \n\nThe final column, `score`, uses `rnorm()` to add random variation by drawing a value from a normal distribution centred on the calculated mean, with a standard deviation of 12. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsimdat <- tibble(\n  datetime = sample(d, size = n, replace = TRUE),\n  rating = sample(1:5, n, replace = TRUE),\n  mean = 50 + month(datetime) - 6 + abs(rating - 3)*5 - 5,\n  score = rnorm(n, mean, sd = 12)\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n### Overplotting\n\nWhen you have a limited range of numeric values, such as an ordinal rating scale, sometimes overlapping data makes it difficult to see what is going on in a point plot.

Organise your report so that the plots are shown **after** the text summary.\n\n9. Edit the YAML header of your quarto document so that your rendered report does not show any code, messages, or warnings.\n\n10. Pick one plot above and make a new version. Adjust the visual aesthetics to make it look as bad and as difficult to read as possible. Save the plot as a PNG image then post this plot to the week 3 thread on Teams and explain why it is so bad. Include the code in your post. \n\n:::\n\n\n## Glossary {#sec-glossary-viz -}\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|term                                            |definition                                                                                                   |\n|:-----------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|[argument](https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/a#argument){target='_blank' class='glossary'}|A variable that provides input to a function.                                                                |\n|[character](https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/c#character){target='_blank' class='glossary'}|A data type representing strings of text.                                                                    |\n|[continuous](https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/c#continuous){target='_blank' class='glossary'}|Data that can take on any values between other existing values.                                              |\n|[default-value](https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/d#default-value){target='_blank' class='glossary'}|A value that a function uses for an argument if it is skipped.                                               |\n|[double](https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/d#double){target='_blank' class='glossary'}|A data type representing a real decimal number                                                               |\n|[geom](https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/g#geom){target='_blank' class='glossary'}|The geometric style in which data are displayed, such as boxplot, density, or histogram.                     |\n|[median](https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/m#median){target='_blank' class='glossary'}|The middle number in a distribution where half of the values are larger and half are smaller.                |\n|[outlier](https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/o#outlier){target='_blank' class='glossary'}|A data point that is extremely distant from most of the other data points                                    |\n|[render](https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/r#render){target='_blank' class='glossary'}|To create a file (usually an image or PDF) or widget from source code                                        |\n|[vector](https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/v#vector){target='_blank' class='glossary'}|A type of data structure that collects values with the same data type, like T/F values, numbers, or strings. |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Further Resources {#sec-resources-viz -}\n\n* [ggplot2 cheat sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/data-visualization.pdf)\n* [Data visualisation using R, for researchers who don't use R](https://psyteachr.github.io/introdataviz/) [@nordmann_2021]\n* [Chapter 1: Data Visualisation](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-visualize) of *R for Data Science*\n* [Writing Meaningful Alt Texts for Data Visualizations in R](https://lizharedogs.github.io/RLadiesNYAltText)\n* [ggplot2 FAQs](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/)\n* [ggplot2 documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/)\n* [ggplot2 version 4.0.0 changes](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2025/09/ggplot2-4-0-0)\n* [Hack Your Data Beautiful](https://psyteachr.github.io/hack-your-data/) workshop by University of Glasgow postgraduate students\n* [Chapter 28: Graphics for communication](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/graphics-for-communication.html) of *R for Data Science*\n* [gganimate](https://gganimate.com/): A package for making animated plots\n\n",
